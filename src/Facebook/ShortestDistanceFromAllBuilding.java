/**
 * You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance.
 * You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:
 * <p>
 * Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
 * Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
 * Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
 * <p>
 * 1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
 * <p>
 * Output: 7
 * <p>
 * Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
 * the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total
 * travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
 * Note:
 * There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.
