 * Let us look at the first scenario above where isBadVersion(mid) = false
 * We know that all versions preceding and including mid  are all good.
 * So we set left = mid + 1left=mid+1 to indicate that the new search space is the
 * interval [mid + 1, right][mid+1,right] (inclusive).
 * The only scenario left is where isBadVersion(mid)â‡’true. This tells us that mid may or may not be the first bad version,
 * but we can tell for sure that all versions after midmid can be discarded.
 * Therefore we set right = midright=mid as the new search space of interval [left,mid][left,mid] (inclusive).
